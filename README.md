# ⚙️ How the System Works

The application follows the **MVC (Model View Controller)** architecture.

### 1️⃣ Model

The **Student model** represents student data.

```
Student
- id
- name
- email
- course
```

---

### 2️⃣ Controller

Controllers handle HTTP requests and communicate with the service layer.

Example endpoints:

```
GET /students       → View student list
POST /students      → Add student
GET /delete/{id}    → Delete student
```

---

### 3️⃣ Service Layer

The service layer handles the **business logic** of the application.

Example operations:

* addStudent()
* getAllStudents()
* deleteStudent()

---

### 4️⃣ View (Frontend)

The frontend is created using **Thymeleaf templates**.

The page contains:

* Student Registration Form
* Student Table List
* Delete Button

---
